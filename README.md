## About This Project:
Bamazon is a javascript node application I had to make for homework, as part of the Northwestern University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, whose purpose was to demonstrate my understanding of incorporating SQL into a node.js application.

## How to Use:
Open bamazonCustomer.js in the command line and simply follow the prompts that were created using the npm package Inquirer. The app will check to see if the answers provided are valid. Above you will find a link to a youtube video demonstrating how the app works.

Bamazon was made using node.js and MySQL.
